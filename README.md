# Electronic-Health-Record-Automation-Tool
Creating a tool to classify text and fill the transcribed text into appropriate EHR sections

Problem Statement: 
Doctors who use Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems face a number of difficulties in their regular work that impede productivity and accurate recording. The laborious task of manually entering data, especially when recording patient contacts and integrating medical terminology and pertinent information in various areas, is a considerable problem. 

Solution:
Use a voice-to-text converter tool specifically made for medical words. The goal of this tool should be to accurately translate spoken medical phrases, including complex terminology, abbreviations, and acronyms, using cutting-edge voice recognition technology that has been trained on medical speech datasets.
Incorporate NLP techniques to analyze the transcribed text and classify it into the relevant sections of the EHR. Utilize pre-trained NLP models or develop custom models to identify and extract medical terms, diagnoses, treatments, medications, allergies, and other relevant information from the transcribed text.
Automatically fill transcribed text into relevant portions of the EHR. 

Tech Stack: 
 NLP Libraries
 Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras)
 EHR Integration: HL7, FHIR, programming languages (Python/C#)
 User Interface (UI) Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Database: MySQL
